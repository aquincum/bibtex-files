# bibtex-files
My collection of citations, and also my bibliography style file.

## The BIB file

`szdref.bib` contains a collection of phonetics/phonology articles I have collected. The collection was started based
on Sylvia Blaho's BIB file, thanks! There is a naming convention of the keys used:

- \citet{authorNN} where NN is the last two digits of the publication date year
- \citet{author1author2NN}
- \citet{author1etalNN}

Not all keys conform this format, there are a lot of entries grandfathered from earlier

## The BST file

`szdref.bst` is pretty standard. It is also adapted from Sylvia Blaho's BST, and was modified slightly.
